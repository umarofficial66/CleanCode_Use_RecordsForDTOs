‚úî C# - Use records for DTOs


In C# 9.0, records were introduced as a powerful feature for creating simple, immutable data types. They prove to be especially advantageous when dealing with Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), as they offer a concise syntax for defining classes primarily used to transfer data between different layers of an application, such as from the business logic layer to the presentation layer.

‚ùá Records are a feature introduced in C# 9.0 that allows you to create simple, immutable data types. They are particularly useful for representing DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) because they provide a concise syntax for defining classes that are primarily used to transfer data between layers of an application, such as between the business logic layer and the presentation layer.

‚ùá Records are best suited for simple data structures and they are not meant to replace classes for all scenarios. For more complex types with behavior, you may still want to use regular classes or other features provided by C#.

‚ùá Records are an excellent choice for creating DTOs due to their simplicity, immutability, and concise syntax, which helps in writing clean and maintainable code.
